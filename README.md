The Comparisons of Machine Learning Approaches -- An example of probability of default of credit card clients
This project focuses on customer's default payments situation in Taiwan and compare the predictive accuracy among five models. Risk prediction is an effective way to prevent crisis. Therefore, this research of predicting credit card default is meaningful. We use data from UCI machine learning data base and analyze default situation of 30,000 customers in Taiwan and give prediction of whether customers default to banks or not. In this study, we fit logistic regression model, Lasso model, Ridge model, Kernel SVM model and Random Forest model to the data. 
According to confusion matric, ROC, AUC graph and accuracy rate, random forest works best.
